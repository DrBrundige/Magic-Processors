R01
In my Progress Notes sheet, I wrote, perhaps too long, about the direction this revision needs to go. My notes can be summarized thus: make it more badass. 

For each color: ten creatures (creature cards or cards that create one or more creatures,) two permanents (auras or colored artifacts) and eight spells (instants, sorceries, or permanents that provide one-off effects.) Among spells, let’s have at least one modular spell per color.
Each color should also have at least one creature that costs one mana. 

White
I’m mostly happy with White. The main thing is that I’m taking out the dino-cowboy shit and replacing it with chefs in Erie Ei, which is now an opulent city. 

Lotus Acolyte 1W
Creature - Human Monk
Prowess. 
2/2
----
The Monastery traveled through the eons to train against the horrors of the future so that they may be prepared for a great battle in the past.

Fight Back to Back 3W
Sorcery
Create two 1/1 white Monk creature tokens with Prowess.
----
“They have us surrounded, the poor fools.”

It occurs to me that Lotus Acolyte in its current form is probably too spicy for common. Here are some replacements.

Monastery Lightspear W Prowess, Lifelink 1/1

Monastery Mice 1W Monastery Mice gets +0/+2 as long as you cast a noncreature spell this turn.  3/1

Erie Ei Flesh Carver W
Creature - Human Artificer
When Erie Ei Flesh Carver enters the battlefield, create a Food token.
1/1
----
Only on Baol would a job as mundane as butcher be given such a title.
Those who refuse to fight are assigned to the kitchens and laundry rooms of Erie Ei. They do their best to save face by giving themselves scary sounding titles.
“Referring to a butcher with a name like that? He’d make a fine sphinx, the way he twists words.”

Erei Ei Provocateur 2W
Creature - Human
Ultra Violence - 1W: Gain 3 life. Put a +1/+1 counter on ~.
1/3

Azzemoth Angel 2WW
Creature - Angel
Flying, Lifelink
3/3

Deputized Silencer 1W
Creature - Human Cleric
When Deputized Silencer enters the battlefield, put a Silence counter on target creature.
2/2

Boxing Knuckles 1W
Artifact - Equipment
Gear Up. (When this Equipment enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 colorless Warrior creature token, then attach this to it.)
Whenever equipped creature attacks, until end of turn, it gets +1/+0 and gains First Strike.
Equip {3}
----
The souls vaguely remembered the concept of boxing gloves from their collective homeworlds, but either forgot or didn’t understand that they were for protection.

Arsenal Captain 4W
Creature - Zombie Soldier
Whenever an equipment with Gear Up enters the battlefield, you may attach it to Arsenal Captain.
4/4
----
The most dangerous weapon a soldier can have is conviction. But conviction is hard to come by these days, so every other possible type will have to suffice.

Abbey Tabby 2W
Creature - Cat
Whenever you gain life or prevent damage, put a +1/+1 counter on Abbey Tabby.
2/2
----
The angelic servants wanted a mascot - unfortunately, on Baol, cute creatures are hard to come by. (Art: a mountain lion)

Dylian Stag 1W
Creature - Elk
Lifelink
2/2
----
With the predators of Baol having all acquired a taste for zombie flesh, their would-be prey roams free.

Chant of Harmony 2W
Enchantment - Aura
Enchant creature.
Enchanted creature can’t attack or block.
At the beginning of each end step, you gain 1 life for each noncreature spell you cast this turn.
----
All day and all night the angels sang their songs of praise, though not a soul stopped to listen until the Order of the Time Travelling Lotus arrived on Baol.

Blinding Fists Technique 3W
Enchantment - Aura
Enchant Creature
Whenever enchanted creature attacks, it gains Double Strike until end of turn.
----
“You’ll have to teach me that one.” Brickston, Heap City ring fighter

Lunch Break 2W
Instant
Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.
Each player that controls a creature creates a Food token.
----
After a hard morning’s worth of busting skulls, it was good to get a chance to pause and enjoy a hot meal.

Angelic Renewal 1W
(Reprint)
----
“The cycle of death and rebirth on Baol mirrors our own teachings on reincarnation. Although nowhere in our sacred texts does it describe the process being quite so violent.”
“Damn you, angel, why won’t you let me die?!”

Finishing Technique W Instant -Destroy target creature that blocked or was blocked by a creature you control this turn. Draw a card.
Thinking about this some more I don’t like that this incentivizes you to cast it after combat, when the monks like spells to be cast beforehand to trigger their Prowess abilities. Let’s go with Bullet Time Technique instead.

Bullet Time Technique W
Instant
Prevent all noncombat damage that would be dealt to you or creatures you control this turn. Draw a card.
----
This could just as be flavored as an angel spell, but this is funnier.

Iron Palm Technique W
Instant
Target creature gets +0/+3 until end of turn. Draw a card.

Angelic Gaze 1W
Sorcery
Choose one: Destroy target artifact or enchantment; Gain 5 life; distribute up to two silence counters among any number of target creatures.
----
I think every color should have a faction-neutral pushed spell.

I Was Not Given Orders to Die W
Instant
Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. If that creature is equipped, it also gains indestructible until end of turn.
----
Ripping off a line from TF2 LMAO I’ll think of something better later.

Erie Ei Meat Bomb 1W
Artifact - Food
When ~  enters or leaves the battlefield, gain 3 life.
{2}, {T}, Sacrifice Erie Ei Meat Bomb: Draw a card.

Blue
Blue might need even less change than White.

Monastery Windwalker 1U
Creature - Human Monk
Monastery Windwalker has flying as long as you’ve cast a noncreature spell this turn.
2/2
----
“Empty your mind of its burdens and you will become light enough for the wind to pick you up and carry you away.”
Improbably, this card has never been printed before.

Inner Eye Meditant 3U
Creature - Human Monk
Noncreature spells you cast that are white or blue cost {1} less to cast.
3/3

Citadel Infiltrator U
Creature - Zombie Rogue
Flying

----
Once he makes it over the channel to the angelic citadel, he can figure out a plan to get back.

Inscrutable Sphinx 5UU
Creature - Sphinx
Flying
When Inscrutable Sphinx enters the battlefield, draw three cards, then discard two cards.
4/4
----
Perhaps its incomprehensible riddles describe unknowable wonders from the days of the Baol. Perhaps after centuries of souls guessing “a bomb,” or “meat,” it has given up on making sense.

Blue Shark 1UU
Creature - Shark
Ward - {3}
3/3
----
Now that we are a good two generations removed from Landwalk being a thing, it’s time for sea creatures to get a new iconic mechanic. I’m making one up right now: it is ward and hexproof.

Calctronic Arcanum 2U
Artifact
{2}: Scry 3
----
“We’re always on the lookout for any tool that can keep us one step ahead of the Time Cops.” Bron, Time Hacker gadget master

(Reprint)
----
“I’ve found that I can indeed run forever” - Jamus Brin, Time Hacker
I looked up the rulings for this card today. LMAO, the permanent’s owner, not the spell’s, decides where to put the card.  As in, you’re almost always paying five mana to set back that card like a turn.

{2}, {T}, Sacrifice ~: Draw a card.
----
A cruel concoction to rend flesh and spirit alike.

Red
I would like some extra creatures with abilities that trigger when they are sacrificed to synergize with black. I fear there’s too much burn even for a set with a mechanic based around damage. Also, I’m changing the color of the wrestlers to RG and making RW eighties-esque gun-toting commandos

Zombie Devil R

Gainlands x10
The iconic Gainland cycle sees something like its sixth printing in a premier set.

Uncommons

R00
Even as testing mainly focuses on commons right now, I’d like to have a few ideas for the uncommons and rares in place so I can start testing in something resembling a real limited environment.

For each color: thirteen uncommon cards. Among these, eight are creatures and five are enchantments, colored artifacts or spells. Four of those creatures relate to a faction mechanic and at least one is an equipment with Gear up. Like this set’s main inspiration NEO, Baol has an above average number of colorless cards: at least ten divided between lands and artifacts. However, it does have the standard ten multicolors: one draft signpost permanent for each combination.

The Uncommons of Baol
At higher rarities, Baol’s main mechanics get to flex their muscles. More colors get access to Gear Up, and they confer splashier abilities. Ultra Violence abilities become powerful to the point where you might try to deal damage on other turns to access them multiple times.

White
At uncommon Monks get to care about noncreature spells beyond simply growing in power. Angels can distribute Silence counters repeatedly.

Monastery War Master 3W
