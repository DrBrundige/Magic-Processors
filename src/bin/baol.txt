What must it be like to be Mark Rosewater, forbidden from reading fan-designed custom sets while also publishing detailed instructions to make those very sets? Anyway, while I’m waiting (on myself) to finish the MSE Card importer, let’s rework the Baol commons using the latest Play Booster skeleton.

White
Eleven creatures with mana values 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5-6, 6-7

Erie Ei Flesh Carver W
Creature - Human Artificer
When Erie Ei Flesh Carver enters the battlefield, create a Food token.
1/1
----
Those who refuse to fight are assigned to the kitchens and laundry rooms of Erie Ei. They do their best to save face by giving themselves scary sounding titles. 

Lotus Acolyte 1W
Creature - Human Monk
Prowess. 
2/2
----
The Monastery traveled through the eons to train against the horrors of the future so that they may be prepared for a great battle in the past. 

Boxing Knuckles 1W
Artifact - Equipment
Gear Up. (When this Equipment enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 colorless Warrior creature token, then attach this to it.)
Whenever equipped creature attacks, until end of turn, it gets +1/+0 and gains First Strike.
Equip {3}
----
The souls vaguely remembered the concept of boxing gloves from their collective homeworlds, but either forgot or didn’t understand that they were for protection.

Dylian Stag 1W
Creature - Elk
Lifelink
2/2
----
With the predators of Baol having all acquired a taste for zombie flesh, their would-be prey roams free.

Abbey Tabby 2W
Creature - Cat
Whenever you gain life or prevent damage, put a +1/+1 counter on Abbey Tabby.
2/2
----
The angelic servants wanted a mascot - unfortunately, on Baol, cute creatures are hard to come by. (Art: a mountain lion)

Erei Ei Hype Man 2W
Creature - Human Artificer
Ultra Violence - W: Gain 3 life. Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
1/3
----
The opulent city of Erei Ei provides souls with everything they could ever need: food, rest, and someone to act amazed at their achievements. 

Deputized Silencer 2W
Creature - Human Cleric
When Deputized Silencer enters the battlefield, put a Silence counter on target creature. 
2/2

Fight Back to Back 3W
Sorcery
Create two 1/1 white Monk creature tokens with Prowess.
----
“They have us surrounded, the poor fools.” 

Azzemoth Angel 2WW
Creature - Angel
Flying, Lifelink
3/3

Arsenal Captain 4W
Creature - Zombie Soldier
Whenever an equipment with Gear Up enters the battlefield, you may attach it to Arsenal Captain. 
4/4
----
The most dangerous weapon a soldier can have is conviction. But conviction is hard to come by these days, so every other possible type will have to suffice. 

High Overseer of The Game 4WW
Creature - Angel
Flying, Vigilance
Whenever you gain life or prevent damage, draw a card. This ability triggers once per turn.
4/4

Judo Technique 2W
Instant
Destroy target creature if its power is 4 or greater or if it’s attacking.
----
More meat means more weight. True strength must come from within. 

Blessing of Repentance 2W
Enchantment
When Blessing of Repentance enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Blessing of Repentance leaves the battlefield. If the exiled creature was tapped, gain life equal to its power. 

Iron Palm Technique W
Instant
Target creature gets +0/+3 until end of turn. Draw a card. 

Angelic Gaze 1W
Sorcery
Choose one: Destroy target artifact or enchantment; Gain 5 life; Distribute up to two silence counters among any number of target creatures. 
----
I get the feeling that this is pushed.
