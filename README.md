Magic Processors

A collection of methods I use to analyze and manipulate card information for Magic: The Gathering cards.

Magic Processor 03:
Takes card names from one place, matches them with Scryfall card objects, and returns the given information on those cards as a CSV.
Download Scryfall bulk data files from https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data and place in the Downloads folder.
Place CSV card files in the Src folder.
Outputs to the Csvs folder.

Magic Sorter 03:
Sorts cards based on any number of fields
Implemented by the Magic Processor.

Magic Deck Upgrades
Matches two lists of cards to find the cards needed.

Process Custom Card Sheet
Processes a text file containing custom card information and outputs to CSV or a file readable by the Magic Set Editor.
